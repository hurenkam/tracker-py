== Fixed since v0.20.2 ==
  * More robust user actions
  * Calibrate map from waypoints
  * Ozi .map files are now parsed correctly if the lines end in dos-style \r\n
  * Tracker now creates data directories on C: if it can't find any
  * Waypoints in mapview now removed from map after delete
  * Close track dialog now shows only open tracks

== Known Bugs ==
  * Sis file does not work on both C: and E: (on my phone it works on C: only, which is also where I installed python)
  * Some gauges sometimes show 'NaN' value
  * OSX/wxpython implementation needs a proper locking mechanism
