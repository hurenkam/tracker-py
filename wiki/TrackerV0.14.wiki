== Current stable version: Tracker v0.14k ==

Unless there is high demand for an update of this branch,
I am considering this the last release in the 0.14 range.
For anyone still using this release, please give 0.20.2 a
try, and let me know what's keeping you from switching.

Available features:
  * Show current position on digitized map
  * Import map from any .jpg and calibrate on your device
  * Add/show waypoints
  * Record/show tracks
  * Set proximity alarm for waypoint, and show heading/distance
  * Tracks & Waypoints saved in GPX format
