== Dynamic menus ==
Currently the menu layout is very static, only the 'screensaver' option
is dynamic. A lot more menu items can be made dynamic however, the option
to 'add refpoint', or 'save map' for instance are depending on a map being 
present.

== Integrate s60views.py and wxviews.py ==
A lot of code in s60views.py and wxviews.py is identical, probably about
80 to 90 percent of the code can be shared between the two. It would be
good to extract the 10-20 percent, and use a single codebase for the rest
of these modules.

== Create SIS package ==
The development has been mostly focussed on getting functionality to work,
for the simple reason that this is what I care about most.
It would be nice to have the code wrapped in a single SIS package, so that
it is easy to install on any phone that has pys60 installed.

== Others? Please let me know! ==
If something is holding you back from using this software, please let me
know what it is. I can add it to this wishlist, and who knows maybe it will
end up on the development chart as well.
