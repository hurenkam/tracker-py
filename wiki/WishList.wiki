=== Import calibrated maps from OziExplorer ===
OziExplorer provides similar functionality as Tracker.py on PC and
PocketPC platforms. It would be nice if maps calibrated with OziExplorer
can be imported for use with Tracker.py

=== Multiple resolutions ===
Current redesign implementation for S60 is aimed at N95 in portrait
mode, meaning it depends on a 240x320 pixel resolution. When used on
other S60 phones, this resolution may not be available, or prefereable,
so support for different resolutions is desired.

=== Dynamic menus ===
Currently the menu layout is very static, only the 'screensaver' option
is dynamic. A lot more menu items can be made dynamic however, the option
to 'add refpoint', or 'save map' for instance are depending on a map being
present.

=== Integrate s60views and wxviews ===
A lot of code in s60views.py and wxviews.py is identical, probably about
80 to 90 percent of the code can be shared between the two. It would be
good to extract the 10-20 percent, and use a single codebase for the rest
of these modules.

=== Create SIS package ===
The development has been mostly focused on getting functionality to work,
for the simple reason that this is what I care about most.
It would be nice to have the code wrapped in a single SIS package, so that
it is easy to install on any phone that has pys60 installed.

=== Use Accelerometer to scroll the map ===
Scrolling the map can be a pain, especially if zoomed in on a large map.
Using the accelerometer would be very handy in this case, simply tilt
your phone in the direction you want to scroll.

=== Exchange of Landmarks ===
A message format could be defined to send/receive Landmarks over SMS/E-Mail/Bluetooth/Other?
When a landmark comes in the user can for instance choose to Display on Map or Save to
Landmarks. Similarly it would be nice if a Landmark, Current Position, or Selected Position
on the map can be send to others. Perhaps an automatic action could also be defined upon
reception of a Landmark. Feature could also be extended to routes/tracks (although
tracks could contain large amounts of data)
Suggested message formats: NMEA, GPX

=== Port to Pocket PC ===
Currently Tracker.py is focussed on symbian S60, and has some support
for other (osx/linux/windows) platforms.
A fully functional port to Pocket PC would be nice, since a lot of them
are also equipped with either a bluetooth or internal GPS.

=== Stable wxPython version ===
Currently Tracker.py is focussed on symbian S60, and has some support
for other (osx/linux/windows) platforms. On osx/linux/windows it uses
the wxpython widget library, but currently the port to this platform
is incomplete and unstable. A stable version on wxpython would help
development efforts enormously.

=== Localization ===
Currently Tracker.py is only available in English. It would be nice if all
UI messages and texts were localized so that other languages can be easily
added.

=== Others? Please let me know! ===
If something is holding you back from using this software, please let me
know what it is. I can add it to this wishlist, and who knows maybe it will
end up on the RoadMap as well.
