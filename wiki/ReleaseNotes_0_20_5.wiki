== Fixed since v0.20.4 ==
  * Fixed menu code (reduced menu items) to deal with limitation in PyS60

== New features in v0.20.5 ==
  * Gauge options for speed/altitude/distance/heading gauges
  * ascent/descent/average altitude
  * average speed
  * ETA in waypoint gauge

== Known Bugs ==
  * Speed gauge sometimes show 'NaN' value/heading sometimes missing
  * Sometimes when exiting gauge options, tracker exits as well
  * OSX/wxpython implementation needs a proper locking mechanism
