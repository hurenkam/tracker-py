Tracker has two main views, uses the left softkey for a menu, the righ softkey as exit,
and the D-Pad center key (ok/select) as a context dependent softkey.

== Menus ==

Currently the menus are not view dependent, which means that the following applies to all
views.

==== Main menu ====

The first option in the main menu is a toggle to switch screensaver on/off.
On the bottom (below the submenus) you find an 'about' option which shows the copyright
info. In between you'll find the Map, Datum, Waypoints, Tracks and Im/Export submenus.

==== Map submenu ====

In this submenu you can 'open' a different map, add reference points 'add refpoint' to
enable calibration (calibration requires at least 2 reference points, and is started
automatically when the 2nd point is added). Also, you can 'save' or clear the calibration
data 'clear all refpoints'.

Put your maps (Ozi, GPSDash, Tracker_v0.14, or plain jpeg) in e:\data\tracker\maps

==== Map submenu ====

The datums submenu allows you to choose from several grid/ellipsoid settings.
Most common are Wgs84 in dd.ddddd, dd mm'ss.ss and dd mm.mmmm formats, and UTM
(with 23 different ellipsoids to choose from).
The dutch RD grid is also included.

==== Waypoints submenu ====

Here you can 'monitor', 'add' and 'delete' waypoints. If you choose 'monitor' then
the direction and distance to that waypoint are shown in the waypoint gauge. Also
you are presented an option to set a proximity alarm.
If you installed the landmarks module, then you can use any landmarks editor to move
landmarks in/out of the waypoints category. Any landmark in the waypoints catagory
will show up in Tracker. These waypoints will also be exported if you choose an export
function.

==== Tracks submenu ====

Here you can 'record' a new track, 'open' an existing track or 'delete' a track.
Open tracks will be shown on the map, and exported if you choose an export function.

== Mapview ==

When in mapview, the keypad is used for browsing the map, keys 2,4,6 and 8 are used as
scrollkeys, when pressed, the Mapview will go into scrollmode, and show a black position
cursor. In case the map is calibrated, you'll see the position at the cursor displayed
in the position box.
The Up/Down button zooms in/out, if zoomed in the scrolling will be in small steps, if
zoomed out, scrolling will take big steps.
By pressing the 5 button, you return to 'follow gps' mode, the cursor will turn blue, and
the position will be updated again with each new position event.

Pressing the ok/select button, then if a map is loaded and current position is on the
map, you will be presented a list of maps available for the current position. If current
position is not on the map, then tracker will autoload the first available map for the
current position.

== Dashview ==

In this view you'll see 6 gauges, one of which is double width & height. You can select
a different 'zoomed' gauge, by selecting up/down.
Gauges present are: Waypoint, Signal (Battery/GSM/GPS), time & distance traveled since
startup, speed and altitude.
Heading & Speed gauges have some form of 'history/cache', meaning that when you travel
slow, they will use the data of several position events to average out heading/speed.
