Off course [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 pyS60]
is needed, tracker.py is written in python, so it needs an interpreter.

The [https://www.iyouit.eu/portal/software.aspx Landmarks module]
is used to interface with symbians internal landmarks database (as used by a.o. 
Nokia Maps). Tracker creates a 'waypoint' category, and places all waypoints there. 
Also, when you use the landmarks editor to assign this category to existing landmarks,
they will show up in tracker.

The [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132176 Envy module]
is used to make tracker a system application, thus preventing it from being 'killed'
by the OS on low memory conditions.
This means you can take photos without tracker.py being killed.

The [http://cyke64.googlepages.com Misty module] is used to implement vibration 
alarms. This is used for the waypoint proximity alarm.

All modules need to be signed at symbian signed, with at least the
Location capability, but possibly others as well.
