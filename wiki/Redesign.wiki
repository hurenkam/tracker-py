  * Waypoint proximity alarm

  * Track recording
  * Im/export of tracks & waypoints in GPX format

== Todo ==
  * Mapview features.
  * Import map
  * Calibrate map

== Code architecture ==
The code is now split into several files, I know, having all in one
place makes it easy to run, but from coding perspective it's a real
nightmare. So, now functionality has been grouped into different
modules.

Because I'm mainly developping on OSX and Linux, the redesign is also
aimed at having the application run on multiple platforms.

=== Generic modules ===

  * datastorage
  * dataprovider
  * osal
  * views

=== S60 modules ===

  * s60datastorage
  * s60dataprovider
  * s60osal
  * s60views

=== OSX/Linux modules ===

  * posixdatastorage
  * simdataprovider
  * posixosal
  * wxviews

=== Windows modules ===

  * simdataprovider
  * ntosal
  * wxviews
